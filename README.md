# resume

The DOC and PDF versions of my resume for all to use.

## Prerequisites

To use these resources the following is what you'll have to do.

* Clone this repository, or download it into your local machine.
* Open and use the `doc` or `pdf` files.

And. There is one more even easier way to access it. Just click on the links as follows for [the doc](https://github.com/JohnNixon6972/RESUME/raw/main/resume.doc) and [the pdf](https://github.com/JohnNixon6972/RESUME/raw/main/resume.pdf) respectively.

## Why this ?

This website was created because of one frustrated [John Nixon](https://johnnixon.me/) who was too bored to write a separate README file that he copied it from [here.](https://github.com/JohnNixon6972/text-to-brainfuck) and also needed an online backup, while allowing fellow GitHub users to use the resume style, and also if you are too curious to find out what John Nixon has really done.

## How this ?

The frustrated Ben Stewart created this using the follows.

The tech stuff used are as follows:

1. [MS WORD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) to make it hard for the open source world.
2. [QR CODE GENERATOR](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) for doing exactly what the app name states.
3. [GITUHB](https://github.com/JohnNixon6972/RESUME) to host the resume and also serve as my backup.

## Contributing

## Important NOTICE
